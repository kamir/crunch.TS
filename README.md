=========

Apache Hadoop is a great place for time series processing. 

"Sessionization" or creation of "Event-Series" from data, collected via Flume,
is a first step towards advanced time series analysis. 

This project contributes several implementations like:

* Detrendet Fluctuation Analysis (DFA)
* Cross-Correlation Analysis (CC)
* Return-Intervall-Statistics (RIS)

to Apache Crunch. Using the Spark, in Memory or MapReduce pipeline, one
can do several analysis steps on a Workstation or in a large cluster.
